								<h3>Hello there!</h3>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>My name is Ken Schnarrs. I'm a computer science major with a minor in mathematical sciences.  I'm currently 21 years old and attending the University of Memphis as an undergaduate junior. I have a passionate love for the field of computer science. I've taken courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, web services, and more, and I've loved them all! If you're looking to know more about me, checkout the <a href="#about">about</a> page.</p>
								<p>I currently do research for my university in the field of cybersecurity. I also am a systems analyst at UMRF Ventures. And I've also done a lot of dev work on the Roblox platform! I've developed and worked on games with millions of plays, having begun developing when I was in my mid-teens. You can find more detail on my work experience on the <a href="#work">work</a> page. I've also worked on some personal projects, including many Roblox games/systems, a to-do web application, and this website! You can find more detail on my projects on the <a href="#projects">project</a> page. If you're in need of a software engineer (albeit intern, part-time, or full-time), or are merely looking to connect to get to know me, you can contact me via the LinkedIn button in the page footer.</p>

								<h3>Vanguard Soaps</h3>
								<p>I would like to say my technical career began right out of high school, when I had my first internship at Vanguard Soaps. I was an "Engineer Intern" in which I coded in JavaScript and SQL. I also did significant work aiding in the creation of manufacturing process guidelines for the machine operators. You can find Vanguard Soap's website <a href="https://vanguardsoap.com/">here</a>.</p>
								<h3>Roblox Corporation</h3>
								<p>During the pandemic, I worked with my friend Grant Fink and some other contributors on a couple Roblox games. I designed a new virtual combat weapon system, which utilizes physics extrapolation and secure client-side response-times to deliver the optimally performant experience. I also included a feature that verifies projectile-to-player collisions by using a clock and physics recording system. Without diving into the technical details, collisions are verified by examining a player's perceived position at a given time compared to what the server saw at that time. If the difference is within a certain amount, the "hit" is approved. Otherwise, the "hit" is denied. You can find one of the games I worked on <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle">here</a>. I was paid by Roblox as a contractor.</p>
								<p>I've continued to work on Roblox games and have received compensation. As of the past year or so, I've worked on <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5702934523/">Trade City</a>. I've added a secure marketplace, virtual currencies, minigames such as Jackpot, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe, and other features.</p>
								<h3>UMRF Ventures</h3>
								<p>I was hired at UMRF Ventures as Systems Analyst in April of 2022. UMRF Ventures is a partner company to FedEx Services and the University of Memphis. My department (Systems Analytics) employs students whom work with real engineering and IT teams to onboard their applications into Splunk in order for them to make searchable, organized business intelligence out of their ugly machine data. In order to do so, we (the systems analysts) utilize Git, Python, RegEx, and many other languages and technologies. So far, I've likely onboarded hundreds of FedEx Services applications into Splunk. UMRF's website can be found <a href="https://umrfventures.com/">here</a>.</p>
								<h3>University of Memphis - Center for Information Assurance</h3>
								<p>For the summer of 2022, I decided to do research for my university, specifically for the Center for Information Assurance. I've researched cybersecurity in critical infrastructure, including doing a case study on the Hampton Roads Sanitation District's ransomware incident. I also have worked with Arduino computer kits a lot, and have programmed them (in C) to do neat things, such as fading light bulbs, changing bulbs colors, making motors work, and more. I have more interesting projects coming up as well. For these projects I am working under the revered professor Dr. Dipankar Dasgupta, who is a nationally recognized computer research scientist. The website for the Center for Information Assurance can be found <a href="memphis.edu/cfia/about/index.php">here</a>.</p>
								<h3>Future</h3>
								<p>Next summer, I'm hoping to get a software engineering internship! I'm applying to any company in the U.S.</p>

								<h3>Web Projects</h3> 
								<p>I plan on working on fullstack web apps this summer! I've already created a To-Do web app with the help of a tutorial. I'm excited to learn more about web development.</p>
								<h3>Roblox Projects</h3> 
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>I started tinkering with scripts on the Roblox platform when I was 12. I then moved on to combining scripts together to create interesting games and systems, but I still did not code much myself. However, by the time I was 15, I was able to make a full-fledged game. I accomplished this in 2017, when I was 16 or 17. The game's purpose was to be an "arena", an environment in which people play with virtual swords.</p>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<!-- <p>The main code is a command script. It uses chat events and string parsing to determine what command the user is executing. It can be used to shape the game environment, reset statistics, and more.</p> -->
								<p>I created some other games between those couple years using that same design. But eventually (in 2019), I decided I want to create an automated game (a game that runs without needing an admin to execute commands). And so I did! You can find that game <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4508384232/Glors-Brick-Battle">here</a>. It's a complete, round-based combat game with levels, points, leaderboards, and more.</p>
								<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5HnPAZnh6A">a YouTube video</a> someone made on my game. It got 100K+ views!</p>
								<p>I was particularly proud of this game. It largely uses a single-script architecture (one script for server, one for client). It had many features and was fun to play. It acquired almost half a million visits.</p>
								<p>I've developed many other games for a gaming community within Roblox. Typically these are arena-style combat games that utilize a similar admin command structure to the one I described above.</p>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<h3>School Projects</h3> 
								<p>I've worked on a few interesting projects throughout my educational career. I've written all of the common data structures in C++. I've also made my own SOAP and REST web services from scratch (programmed in Java).</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>Currently, I'm living in Collierville, Tennessee, which is a suburb of Memphis. I was born in New Jersey. When I was 8, my family moved to Pennsylvania. Then, when I was 16 or 17, we moved to Collierville, where I attended Collierville High School. In my free time, I enoy working out (weight lifting), spending time with family, friends, and pets, and going outside for walks!</p>
								<p>My interest in computer science and programming began when I was around 12 (late 2011). I started by tinkering with scripts on the Roblox platform as I wanted to make my own games that I could play on. Eventually, after many years of learning, I was able to build the games that I dreamed of as a kid. You can find out more about my games and projects on the <a href="#projects">projects</a> page. </p>
								<p>My desire to learn in tech has continued throughout all my life so far! My decision to make computer science my major was solidified when I took an AP Computer Science course in high school. Because of my programming background, I found the course very easy and fun.</p>
								<p>While in university, I've learned a lot. I've picked up new languages such as Java and C++. I've had an internship where I coded in JavaScript and SQL, as well other jobs that have aided in my technical development. I'm continuing to learn everyday, and am always welcome to new opportunities!</p>
